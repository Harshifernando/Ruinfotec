            <br><br>
            <p class="intro">To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set 
            (character encoding) to use.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>What is Character Encoding?</h2><br><br>
            <p>ASCII was the first <strong>character encoding standard</strong> (also called character 
            set). It defines 127 different 
            alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet.</p><br>
            <p>ASCII supported numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special 
            characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ &lt; &gt; .</p><br>
            <p>ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. It supported 256 different 
            character codes. </p><br>
            
            <p>ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. It 
            also supported 256 different character codes. </p><br>
            
            <p>Because ANSI and ISO were limited, the default character encoding was changed to UTF-8 in HTML5.</p><br>
            <p>UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.</p>
